A Siebel CRM upgrade and iplementation project aimed at increasing sales, improving customer service, and reducing internal costs. This project was undertaken to add functionality essential for the realization of the business goals of taking the customer service to the next level for greater return on investment, customer retention and improved productivity.

This project was a very capital intensive one and it was essential to gain an understanding of the following early on:

- The actual IT costs of the project
- The anticipated benefits and when they were expected to be delivered
- The prerequisite process steps, both technical and business, to obtaining the benefits
- The necessary commitment by the business of time and resources to the project

Upon gathering the required information, a comprehensive project plan was created and a project charter was signed to commence the project. After a successful upgrade, a change management program was initiated where rollout dates were communicated to users, training was scheduled, and adequate time was allowed for end users to adjust to the enhancements, and a process was created for users to provide feedback to the project team. User adoption was critical to a successful upgrade so users had access to a test environment that allowed them to become familiar with the new version of the application, and end-user training was delivered on the upgraded application.
