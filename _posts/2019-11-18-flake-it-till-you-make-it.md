This Project was borne of the need to have a company wide uniform ERP system to reduce IT operational costs, automate processes, increase productivity, reduce/re-purpose headcount and retire a costly, obsolete legacy system. Disconnects between finance, sales, treasury caused by multiple software platforms, allowed for increased errors and wasted employee time trying to fix problems, find needed information, or reconcile transactions.

There was a dire need for ERP system functionality with software pieces for Customer Relationship Management (CRM), sales automation, a business partner management system, and an integrated human resources application in order to streamline processes and stop work redundancy, increase and improve interaction internally and between customers and suppliers. There was a lot of productivity to be gained from seamless communication between suppliers, sales, marketing, finance and business associates.
