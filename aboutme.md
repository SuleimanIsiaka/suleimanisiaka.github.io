### Data Enthusiast

I am an aspiring Data Analyst with expertise in the discovery, manipulation, interpretation, and visualization of data to provide actionable insights guiding important business decisions. I have a flair for exploring the relationships between numbers and translating them into stories and visualizations. I am fluent in the use of MySQL, Microsoft Excel, Tableau Desktop, and I would like to use my skills to be a valuable resource a companys decision making.

I am adept at writing database queries, creating dashboards/reports, and presenting my findings in concise, simple yet impactful presentations.

### Coding Student and Avid Gamer

When I am not creating Business Analysis documentation/diagrams, Tableau and Microsoft Excel Pivot dashboards, I like to try my hands on coding in Python programming language as I aspire to one day become a capable software engineer. When I am not doing any of that, I like to play RPG, RTS, and sports video games.
